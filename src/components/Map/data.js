        "This happened to my mom's washing machine, I bought the parts and fixed it myself which cost about $150.  After replacing those parts the washer still would not work. Long story short there was nothing wrong with the washing machine, the water pipe valve was broke....",
        "Story time!  I sell appliances for a living.  About 2 months ago one of my good friends tells me he needs a new set of front loading laundry because the set of Whirlpool units he got 5 years ago are already falling apart.  He tells me he's got $3k to spend but he doesn't want the same garbage he's already got.\n\n\nI tell him, \"Great, I have the perfect set for you.  They are built tough, carry a 5 year parts and labor, and are well within your budget.  Keep in mind though, they don't have all the crap bells and whistles the more commodity brands have.  The capacity is reasonable but not ginormous, they don't come with steam or wifi, and they're nothing pretty to look at.\"\n\n\nLong story short, he got another Whirlpool set because the wife wanted a fancy color and ginormous capacity and steam on both pieces... Whatever, right? It's his money he can burn it however he wants. Who am I to tell him what he wants?  All I can do is educate him on the differences and he can make his own decisions.\n\n\nThis is a perfect example of why my industry is the way it is right now.  Each brand just wants to make money and they will follow whatever consumer trends they can in that endeavor.  Yes there are brands that are an exception but those are niche brands for, at this point, a niche market. \n\n\nThe day after my buddy got his new set delivered we were having a guys night at another friends and this topic came up. He asked, \"Why don't they make something built with quality and has all the features we're looking for?\" Well, they did. However, the market doesn't support \"luxury\" laundry because people don't want to spend $4k for a washer and dryer so they stopped making them.\n\n\nHere's the lesson kids, if you want something that's going to last you're going to pay more for it and it won't have all the bells and whistles that we never knew we needed.  Spare me your anicdotal evidence to the contrary, we sell thousands of laundry sets per year. You want more options for quality? Put your money where your mouth is.\n\n\nIn the end, just like OP has experienced, we are rapidly approaching disposable appliances unless the almighty consumer starts to change their spending habits.  You want someone to blame for why there is no quality left in things built today? Don't demonize the brands, they're just doing what you told them you wanted.\n\n\nEdit: OP, if this is your sign in the picture and you're in this situation with GE, shoot me a PM and I'll see if there's anything that can be done. We do enough business with GE that we have a little pull.  No promises but I can at least fire off an email or two.\n\n\nNinja Edit:  Here is some advise I have on how to find a trustworthy sales person in their area...\n\n\n>Its important to have someone you trust. Here's a great tip. Next time you're looking for an appliance, tell the sales person that your machine is starting to go out and you think its time to replace it. If they immediately launch into a sales pitch you should walk away because they probably do not have your best interests in mind. If they ask you what is wrong with your current unit and try to give you tips to get it back up and running again, you know they have your best interests in mind and are trustworthy.\n\n>I talk someone out of buying new appliances at least once a week. It helps me sleep at night and I still create a customer, just not immediately.\n",
        "FYI - GE appliances are actually made and sold by Chinese manufacturer Haier. When Haier purchased the business from GE, they also agreed to license the ‘GE Appliances’ trademark for 20+ years. \n  \nEdit: I should add more. \n  \nGE Washers are still made by hardworking Americans at the ~~Georgetown~~Louisville, KY plant. GE gave up on the unionized plant long ago, consequently ignoring investment in that business for years while they tried to find a buyer.  Walk through the site and you can see the neglect and downfall of the business. \n  \nFrom a product standpoint, instead on focusing on design for robustness, they did look to answer competition from LG and Samsung by gimmicking their top-tier washer line - adding features like ‘pour a whole bottle of detergent in and well dose it out’. \n  \nI don’t believe the market exists for a full-featured last-forever washer. Customers want to walk into Home Depot and buy a washer for $600 that saves water, runs quietly, is full of technology...yadda yadda... but in constant dollars, costs them way less than then the simple plain white workhorses - just ‘motor + timer’ units - sold 20 years ago. \n  \nTheir out-the-door product complaint rate, measured by service calls in the first 90 days, is - per the plant manager there - the same or better than the competition. I believe they want that number less than 15%. \n  \nIt isn’t ‘planned obsolescence’ - meaning that they spec a motor that has a programmed 3year lifetime. I would argue, in their defense, is that the number of components and their associated costs is much, much higher today - as is the chance for one of them failing based on probability - than in the units made years ago. \n\n",
        "1 year warranty = 1.5 year product lifespan",
        "This will get buried by my father-in-law works for a company's product development team (I won't mention the name) and he has said time and time again that the company spends more money determining how long the product will last and tailoring warranties to meet that timeline (failure analysis) rather than extending the life of the product.  Because of the additional value of extended warranties or you re-buying are worth more than extending the life-span of the product.  \n\n\nSo you can bet if a product comes with a 5 year warranty, they've done their research to determine that the failure typically occurs after the 5 year point (probably at year 6). ",
        "This echos my experience.  My mom paid 2 Grand for a GE stove, didn't last two years before the glass came unglued from the door and shattered on the floor.",
        "That’s why in Europe we have \n\n>\tFree of charge, 2-year guarantee (legal guarantee) for all goods\n\n[see europa.eu](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/index_en.htm)\n",
        "~Unpopular opinion follows~\n\nAdmittedly, with foreign competition (Such as LG/Samsung/Haier), and increasingly complex and computerized appliances, the dream of a simple and sturdy appliance that'll last 30 years isn't realistic anymore. Many people want to replace/upgrade appliances every decade or so both for aesthetics, and new technology, so the financial incentive to focus on a bulletproof product that lasts half a century isn't really there. \n\nI have a pair of top end washer/dryer from GE (King comforter capacity, steam, etc.), and I've had probably a half dozen total service calls on both. Washer's rubber gasket/boot disconnected, easy fix. Dryer had a fried main board (shoddy 1970s aluminum wiring grounded via the water pipes, ended up having to replace entire circuit with a new grounded 4 pin for safety), rollers went out, belt got a nick in it, and drum eventually was no longer round (slight oval/egg shape causing clunking noises), and all of them were replaced/repaired for free...with extended warranty. \n\nAs shitty as it sounds, many appliances today are same price or *cheaper* than they were in the [1980s, and that's without factoring the higher trust costs then due to 3 decades of inflation](http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/80selectrical.html), so it's better to get what you need, get an extended protection plan on big dollar items (Fridge, washer/dryer, possibly range), and simply upgrade when smaller/cheaper stuff break. \n\n(No, I'm not defending the worsening reliability of consumer products, just highlighting why that is happening)",

It's just circular reasoning, presuming that more features were needed in the first case. \n\nIf you are interested in convincing anyone of the utility of a redesign, you would need to articulate _which_ new features it would enable, and make a case for those being worthwhile. Refactoring is a means, not and end unto itself.\n\nReddit doesn't have technical problems, it has community and administration problems.

        "Could we have a preference option to default to old.reddit.com instead of the redesign? I've been using the new style for a bit now, and I'm still not finding the overall experience is particularly enjoyable for a few key reasons.\n\n1. I mostly come to reddit because I'm interested in the discussion, and the new reddit hides the number of comments way on the other side of the page from all the other information. Since the redesign I've found myself opening 0 comment threads constantly. As an addendum; I don't actually care what the actual numeric score of a submission is; it's clearly high enough to be on my front page, beyond that the number doesn't affect how I'll interact with the story. Before it was sort of low key, but now this part is doubly emphasized with both very prominent positioning, and the extra space taken by the up/down arrows.\n\n2. The modal view for single left click is not very comment friendly. Now if I'm writing a long comment all it takes is a misplaced click, and all my work is lost. At the very least there should be a warning when trying to close a modal with text in a comment form.\n\n3. I would always browse subreddits with custom CSS turned off, because I like the clean and consistent experience. With the redesign a bunch of subreddits now have a huge banner that takes a lot of my screen real estate for no particular reason. It would be nice to opt into a more minimal UI that tries to conserve screen real estate.\n\n4. Putting the \"Hide\" button in the extra menu makes it much less useful. Previously if I found myself seeing the same stories too often I could just go down the list and hide the ones I've seen. Now it's a long mouse movement and then 2 clicks to hide something, which makes it much less usable.\n\n5. With the emphasis on opening the comment thread from the topic list, there's now much more mouse movement involved in opening an actual link. Though I do appreciate how it's easier to get to comments now, it would be nice to have the link itself be in a more consistent position.",
        "Are you guys planning on adding subreddit filtering back on?\n\nI browse /r/all more than I probably should, but it's one of the things keeping me from joining the redesign since I'm not able to block certain subreddits that I don't feel like seeing (for a variety of odd reasons)",
        "Sounds pretty neat, hope it goes well",
        "Which wannabe social media bullshit are you shoving up our ass this time?",
        "To be honest, the \"Classic\" theme aside which is somewhat palatable, all the new themes are flat out horrible.\n\n- Card looks like Reddit and Tumblr had a big ugly child that looks like those long forgotten blogs from the early 2000. To put it Deadpool style, it \"look like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah\". Also having ads appear as posts is as honest as if you were trying to get us into some multilevel marketing scheme which to say the least is very VERY scummy.\n\n- Compact on the other hand looks like the default theme Reddit has now but somehow broke halfway during the loading of the page and results in half the content going AWOL. Alternatively it reminds me of those darknet websites you see in some shows on TV's that sell a whole bunch of illegal stuff. So on one hand it looks like the design team got very drunk and broke a good part of the code and on the other it looks like Reddit became a website that sells illegal stuff. All in all that's not exactly a good impression.\n\n- Now as for the \"Classic\" theme the only problem it has as far as I can see is the font used which looks very close to Comic Sans MS, and while I'm sure there's people in your team that love shiba inus, having the whole website look like an old meme straight out of r/doge isn't exactly a good way to make your site attractive. Instead it looks like the team consists of 70-year olds who are desperately trying to fit in with their grandkids by wearing rapper clothing and saying \"swag\" more often than a pornstar moans.\n\nSo the TL;DR is that while I can understand the wish to give the site a refresh, it really feels like you guys thought more about if you could do it and not much about if you should do it.",
        "Honestly I spent 10 minutes in a preview of the redesign and noped right back out of it. I really don't like it. Especially the way it totally ignores window width and artificially limits the column displaying posts on the main page.",

It doesn't benefit me as a reader and I seriously doubt Reddit's advertisers want that either. These posts really need a distinctive border or background color so I'm not reading them with my 'gatekeeping' senses turned on. ",

Probably makes a difference in choice when you can’t read lol",

I remember my mom bought my siblings and I a gamecube but she wasn't sure which games to pick.

        "So...I have to confess to something. I worked in the R Zone at Toys R Us for the PS2 launch. At the time, the N64 was still huge and we couldn’t keep Majora’s Mask in stock. Whenever we ran out, or whenever someone was getting their kids Majora’s Mask and another game, they would ask me for recommendations. I would give them some general suggestions like Mario Kart or Mario 64 and the like. However, I was really into Harvest Moon at the time and I would always geek out on it when I had the chance. If someone asked for something educational, I would always bring up how great it was for learning about managing times and finances. I’d also talk about how engaging it was to build your farm up from almost nothing and maintaining relationships while still keeping up with your responsibilities.\n\nIt just so happened that our store was consistently out of stock on Harvest Moon 64 and often out of stock on Harvest Moon: Back to Nature for the PSX. If you live in the central Ohio area and you got Harvest Moon for Christmas 2001, it’s likely that it was my fault.",
        "I saw a kid playing the Switch on display at a Target and he was playing Breath of the Wild. His mom was watching him, and at one point he said “The graphics are so bad, it’s like we’re back in 2002.”\n\nI didn’t say anything, but now I’m wondering if I should have leaned over to the mom and said “I wouldn’t recommend keeping that son, he’s really bad.”",

        "I'd laugh so hard if the kids actually did want the trolls game and that OP ruined their birthday by making them get some garbage game instead of the one they wanted. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love BOTW, but I'd be shitty if I was a kid and missed out on a game that I wanted because some manchild told my mother to buy me something else.",
        "And then everyone clapped",
        "You probably did the right thing. But, growing up, during the NES days, some of my fondest video game memories are from trerrible games. Bad Street Brawler, Super Glove Ball (with the Power Glove) and some weird Game Boy games are the ones which really stick out.  \nYeah, I still love Mario, MegaMan 2 and Dragon Warrior to this day, but crappy games have their place in a child's memory too.",
        "What makes Troll and I so bad? Never really heard of it.",
        "> So I was at Toys R Us earlier today to pay my respects to my childhood store.\n\nAs did I recently, but, at least on the inside, the store I knew 20 years ago was long gone. Everything was completely rearranged.",

This kid, experiencing the closing of Toys R Us, without embracing it for long, possibly his last experience and the last thing he would ever get from it....is Troll and I. The pain on top of pain causes him to grow up dark and depressed, thus becoming on of the most evil and corruped superpowers in the future, who BANS ALL VIDEO GAMES FROM THE PLANET! \n\nThus OP is sent back in time to stop this by making the experience enjoyable with a game that's so good and  grand it's merely a *legend* in the future. \n\nBut now, OP is stuck, how will he tell his future comrads that the mission is complete? How will he get home? Do they even exist in this timeline? Who knows.

Is it \"faked\"?  \n* I have seen demos that show pseudo 3D, but how the hell is this done here, considering the camera follows quite a complex \"path\" in a scenery that changes constantly?  \n* How did they do the small detail?

Told us it was real and it fucked us up for a while. I realize that kind of pales in comparison, as it wasn't real, but it brought back a bad memory.

Looking back I guess I never really grasped what I was truly watching and seeing and assumed most of it was fake. Ten years later I’m looking back like damn, that dude really got his head chopped off and people out there really do that shit and other sick shit as well. It was a bit of a, for lack of a better word- “culture shock” too just realize what exactly goes on in this world. That poor kid who couldn’t talk from watching them, I hope nothing but the best for the kids in the future. I couldn’t imagine making someone watch one of those vids who had no desire too, they really do fuck/change you up. ",
        "Fucking good",
        "Normally I'd be extremely wary of child abuse cases due to my own experience being the target of a false positive, but if the kids are the ones ringing the bell there is 100% SOMETHING wrong, and a child being left unable to speak takes the cake. That doesn't just happen out of nowhere, and normal parents would be looking for help under every overturned rock they can find. \nAssuming it's true that they weren't looking for help for their child at all, that's enough to mark them abusive to me. When my parents found out my sister had physical problems of a chronic nature (though its still not 100% what collection of shit she has), they didn't stop looking even when doctors said it was nothing big (which it clearly was, since it stopped her things she really enjoyed).\nThat's the sort of thing a parent does when there's something wrong with their child, and lack of doing that marks you as a bad parent all by itself.\nI hope these 'parents' feel the full extent of justice for whatever it turns out they actually did, and I hope all the kids can recover from this experience and grow up to live healthy and fulfilling lives.\n",

        "The parents names are being withheld for legal reasons. What? They’re at least in jail for child abuse and awaiting trial right? They’re not still on the streets interacting with civilians right?",
        "Man those are some pretty smart kids, it’s good that they got away while they could. However, though I hate saying this, I would be lying if I said this didn’t remind me of 1984 a bit. That part where kids are being encouraged to turn in their parents for going against the party’s wishes. In this case it’s definitely justified, but say it was a different group, like kids turning in their parents for watching right wing videos. The definitions are so broad right now I’m actually nervous about that, especially after that “grossly offensive” Count Dankula video got a man put in jail. I want to reiterate I’m glad these kids turned in their parents, and it terrifies me that other kids have to grow up in this environment, I’m just hoping this doesn’t go full 1984 on everyone’s asses.
