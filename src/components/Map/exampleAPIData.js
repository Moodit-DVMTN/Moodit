"That was frightening."

"This gives me large amounts of anxiety. "
3

"Werewolves would be big af"

"The Moon would break up due to tidal forces at that distance. The Roche limit for the Earth-Moon system is about 18,000km, about halfway between low Earth orbit and Geostationary orbit."

"I was just waiting to get my ocarina out and find the weird guy with the music box "

"Dawn of the final day: 24 hours remain"
19
:
"Just a small doubt. Would we still have phases of moon at this distance ? "
20
:
"It bugs me how instantaneous it goes from dark to light. Unless the moon is also sprinting around the Earth too."
21
:
"THREE DAYS"
22
:
"Anyone else annoyed it isn't tidally locked?"
23
:
"Looks like you only have a few hours to get the Majora's mask to the happy mask salesman."
24

"Major‚Äôs Mask! "
25
:
"this is so discomforting"
26
:
"That was extremely uncomfortable to watch. I felt a chill run through my whole body. Yikes!"
27
:
"Also, if your mama would be as close as Pluto."
28
:
"How much higher would we be able to jump if we jumped as it was passing overhead? Would the earths gravity be affected?"
29

"Super Creepy"

35
:
"I have a lot of dreams/awe-inspiring nightmares with imagery a lot like this."
36
:
"think of the gravity effects...almost weightless for 30 seconds....and the tides!"
37
:
"Quickly, play the song of time!"
38

"So melancholia. Dat movie was great. Titties"
39

"And how long would this last until we collide?"

"damn, i'm glad that prick is getting further away from us."
41
:
"Bruce almighty already did it"
42
:
"Everyone taking about anxiety and I'm over here like "how do we make this happen?""
43
:
"I love this and I dont know why. I just keep watching it. üòç"
44
:
"I‚Äôve had dreams like this. Anyone else?"
45
:
"Well, that was fun and terrifying. "
46
:
"All of those pictures of Batman standing in front of it would be a lot more realistic. "
47
:
"This is horrifying "
48
:
"This would be a minor inconvenience when I'm trying to do cloud watching "
49
:
"I do not like it. "
50
:
"Go ahead, watch this on your VR headset. I dare ya. "
51
:
"I didn't expect that to be terrifying. It was."
52
:
"This is freaking amazing"
53
:
"Will OP or whoever made this gif be able to show how the moon would look at Roche limit? thanks üôè "
54
:
"I saw Bruce almighty do this with an invisible rope"
55
:
"The gravity effects would be horrifying enough for there to be always active volcanoes everywhere."
56
:
"And still wouldn‚Äôt have a clue what the dark side of the moon looks like "
57
:
"That would be so cool but we'd all die"
58
:
"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no moon...‚Äù"
59
:
"That‚Äôs no moon! "
60
:
"So why would it become transparent?"
61
:
"Except the Moon has a radius of a little over 1,700km and the ISS is only 408km above us.  In that orbit it would be skidding across the Earth digging a line deep into the magma"
62
:
"Do Jupiter"
63
:
"That's terrifying"
64
:
"Now make a version where the sun is the same distance as the moon! "
65
:
"Assuming you cloud actually have the moon that close to Earth without something horribly wrong not happening. What would the gravitational effects be on Earth?"
66
:
"Then it would be see through"
67
:
"Haven't been more intimidated by the moon as right now."
68
:
"What would it look like if it was the distance of the moon away?"
69
:
"Was I the only one that was like "yay, daily eclipse?" I know we'd be dead meat in seconds, tidal forces, Moon debris and that stuff, but still is a totally interesting perspective to have complete darkness for some time during the day."
70
:
"I‚Äôve got Majora‚Äôs Mask vibes from this"
71
:
"That's no moon."
72
:
"I just about had a panic attack. Jesus H. Christ. That is frightening. "
73
:
"What would happen to the earth if that was the actual distant... Ill assume nothing good? "
74
:
"I don‚Äôt know why but this is terrifying "
75
:
"It would be much more opaque, though."
76
:
"holy shit, that's terrifying."
